Code Analysis:
resolveAfter2Seconds() Function:

This function returns a Promise that resolves after 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds).
The setTimeout function is used to delay the execution of the resolve function by 2 seconds. When resolve is called, it passes the string 'resolved' to the resolve function, which fulfills the promise.
asyncCall() Function:

This is an async function, meaning it can use the await keyword to wait for promises to resolve.
It first logs the string 'calling' to the console.
Then it uses await to pause the execution of the function until the promise returned by resolveAfter2Seconds() is resolved.
After the promise resolves (which takes 2 seconds), the result 'resolved' is stored in the result variable and logged to the console.
Invocation of asyncCall():

The function asyncCall() is called at the end of the script, triggering the process described above.
Expected Outcome:
When the code runs:

The string 'calling' is immediately logged to the console.
The execution of the asyncCall() function is then paused for 2 seconds due to the await keyword.
After 2 seconds, the promise resolves with the value 'resolved'.
The string 'resolved' is then logged to the console.


calling
resolved

The output occurs with a 2-second delay between the two log statements. The first log ('calling') happens immediately, and the second log ('resolved') appears 2 seconds later.
